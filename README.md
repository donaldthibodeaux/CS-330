How do I approach designing software?

  My apprpach is study the material that I am given then try find as many examples of the techiques that I can find. I am a more visual learner so like to watch videos on the subject that I can.
  
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  On this projects I worked with somethinf totally unkown to me which is opengl. I believe this class has taught me that much mre practice and time is needed to really hone my craft. It made me relized I have much more to learn. I have learn the started process of working with opengl c++. And i want to try really understand and use this platform.
  
What design process did you follow for your project work?
   Really for this project I really do not have a design process because there so many different ways to go about it so I think I really need t do more work on finding the correct process for me.
   
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I believe for future this has taught me that frastration is not the answer it is best to stick with and try to keep going no matter what.
How do I approach developing programs?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
the use of vets and indices to draw object were new and camera matrix.

How did iteration factor into your development?
I believe in opengl iteration is a very big part of graphics.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Honestly I believe this class has taught I have a long way to go in my coding journey.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I believe computer sceience is a stron bachbone to reaching my goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I believe computational graphics and visualizations is something that I need to learn inorder to help me on educational path.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I believe computational graphics and visualizations is something that i will continue to try to conquer because i do believe it is something that I may need for the future.
